generic grbl message parser based on work by Terje Io

https://github.com/terjeio/GRBL_MPG_DRO_BoosterPack



main usage is to call gc_parseData( serial_line_data), this will update the grbl_data struct with any changes and the values of those changes.

if simply waiting for a state change you can call grblParseState ( new_message, current_state).  if it returns true the state has changed
